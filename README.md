## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent Bachelor of Engineering graduate specializing in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently focused on developing my skills in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have hands-on experience with Bootstrap for responsive web design. My recent projects include "Nebula," an e-commerce application and task management dashboard, showcasing my abilities in full-stack development and UI/UX design.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
